# Hi There 👋, We're FIRST team 8546: Team Linebreak!

Founded in 2020, we are a FIRST team made of members from Idaho's treasure valley. 2020 was technically our rookie year but with COVID we were not able to compete. 2021 was our veteran rookie year where we competed in the Idaho regional and placed 1st on an alliance with [Team Tators](https://www.teamtators.org) and [Peninsula Robotics](https://www.team6036.com). As a result of our ID regional win, we competed in the FIRST championship in Huston TX.
